[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grahamcrackers/strapi-layout-editor.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/grahamcrackers/strapi-layout-editor)

## An Experience Editor for strapi projects

Uses [`react-grid-layout`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-grid-layout) for ordering strapi content.

## Start Your Strapi Server

For this application to work, you must point your application to a running strapi api. Currently, the only version I have tested this against is `strapi@3.0.0-beta.16.5`.

Note: This is only a working UI at this point, you won't be able to save anything to the strapi database.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
